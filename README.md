# A Decade of Game Grumps VS - 2013 to 2023

Game Grumps VS is a YouTube video series started in 2023 where the popular Game Grumps compete against each other in video games of various genres. This project utilizes web scraping code to scrape likes, views, and dates from Game Grumps VS. Youtube videos without using expensive Youtube API, processing and cleaning the data, and exporting it for use in Tableau Dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/data.science.donut/viz/ADecadeofGameGrumpsVs/RawDetail). 

Tableau Dashboard utilizes machine learning principles such as NLTK sentiment analysis. Two versions of the Tableau Dashboard were published on r/gamegrumps (one six months before the 10-year anniversary of the show and one on the anniversary of the show) to incorporate user feedback and suggestions.
